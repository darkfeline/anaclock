# anaclock

anaclock prints a simple analog clock as a line of text.

Demo:

    $ anaclock
    23  .  :  .| 00

anaclock is easy to use in CLI prompts or anywhere else you can print
the time, but you want an analog clock instead.

Example values:

     :  .  12 .  :  # 12:00
    12| .  :  .  13 # 12:05
    00 |.  :  .  01 # 00:10
    23  .  |  .  00 # 23:30

Why use an analog clock?  Same reason we use graphs instead of a table
of numbers; it's easier to visualize how much time has passed and how
much is remaining.  Of course, your results may vary.
